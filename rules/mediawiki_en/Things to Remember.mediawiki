The first line of your orders must begin with [[ERESSEA|ERESSEA <faction no.> <password>]], where you replace <faction no.> with the id of your faction, and <password> with your password. A line containing the word [[NEXT]] should be at the very end of your order file, telling the server that your orders are finished completely, and that it should ignore everything else in your email.

You can write one order per line. If your mail program breaks long lines, then you have to add a continuation character at the end of the line. Simply add a \ at the end to tell the game server to continue processing in the next line, like this:

  DESCRIBE UNIT "The heroes of the second war on Andune have enjoyed \
       their retirement for long. Now their country depends upon \
       them once again, and they march against the Dark Alliance."
