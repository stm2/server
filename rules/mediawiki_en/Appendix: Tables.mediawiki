The column &quot;max. trees&quot; specifies the number of trees (a young tree is counted as 1/2 tree) that can fill up all the space in the region and make working impossible. Note that a region can contain more trees than the amount specified here.

In glaciers, swamps and deserts, roads can only be built in combination with certain buildings.
