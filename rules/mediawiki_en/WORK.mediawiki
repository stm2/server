<tt>WORK <L></tt>

Tells the unit to do manual labor, working in agriculture or fishing. It will produce enough silver to survive, but little more. The exact salary depends on the size of the biggest local fortification. Orcs will earn less than others. A unit aboard a landed ship cannot work if the region is guarded by a faction that is not allied with it.
