There is more than one face behind Eressea, and not everyone can answer all of your questions. To simplify communications, there are a number of addresses you can write to for help. If you have a question about the rules, please try writing to [mailto:eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de]  first. Your email will be read by volunteer players that are helping us deal with the sheer amount of questions that beginners usually have. They also know of any existing bugs in the game, should you be so unlucky to encounter one.

If you feel your question must be answered by a gamemaster or developer, send it to [mailtop:eressea-bugs@eressea.kn-bremen.de eressea-bugs@eressea.kn-bremen.de]. If you found a new and previously unknown bug, see the section on [[bug|bug reports]] for details on how to report bugs.
