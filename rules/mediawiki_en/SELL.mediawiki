<tt>SELL amount luxury   <(L)><br>
SELL ALL luxury   <(L)></tt>

A unit skilled in trade can use this order to sell the luxury items it owns to the peasants. As a presupposition, a tradepost needs to be erected in the region and there needs to be a demand for the luxury good. Trade does not require the permission of the local sovereign but it might be more diplomatic to request it, nevertheless.

When on board a ship in a [[GUARD|guarded]] region you can trade only if you are either [[Alliances|allied]] with the guarding factions or they [[CONTACT|contact]] your merchant.

For further reference, see the [[Trade|trade chapter]].

<tt>SELL ALL</tt> automatically sells the amount of the luxury item that is demanded in the region. This will also work if more than one faction gives this order, or if somebody in the region is recruiting.

<tt>SELL</tt> is a pseudo-long order, just like [[BUY]]. You can combine both and trade at most skill-level(trade) Ã— 10 luxury items per turn but issue no other long order.

[[BUY]] and <tt>SELL</tt> do not appear in the standard report, so it looks as though merchant units had no default order. But this is only to prevent a long list of orders in the report. The computer report and the orders template show these orders only if you add the @ prefix to them.
