Men trying to escape will attempt to do so every round, and may take damage before they successfully escape.

* Men with [[COMBAT|COMBAT FLEE]] will try to flee if they are [[ATTACK]]ed.
* Men with [[COMBAT|COMBAT NOT]] or [[COMBAT|COMBAT DEFENSIVE]] will try to flee if they fall below 90% of their total hit points.
* Men with [[COMBAT]] or [[COMBAT|COMBAT REAR]] will try to flee if they fall below 20% of their total hit points.
* Men with [[COMBAT|COMBAT AGGRESSIVE]] will never flee.

The basic chance to flee is 25% (50% for halflings) plus 10% if one has a horse and 5% for each level in stealth, but its capped at 75% (90% for halflings).

Units that flee retreat from battle and watch its outcome from a safe distance. If during a fight at least one person is fleeing from a unit, then the entire unit leaves the building they were standing in.

All units with STATUS FLEE are allowed to move after the battle, even if they aren't allowed to execute long orders. Units with STATUS FLEE cannot guard the region. If a unit with this status is currently guarding a region, it will stop doing so from this week on.
