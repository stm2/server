First things first: Cheating gets you banned.

Cheating spoils the game for everybody. We consider the following to be cheating:

;Sending orders for another faction.
:The exception being vacation replacements. If you are going on vacation, and somebody else sends in your orders during this time, please make this visible to the GMs and other players using the EMAIL and BANNER orders.

;Playing more than one faction.
:This is by far the form of cheating that's been practiced most. We have had to kick countless players because of it. Playing more than one faction, sometimes called "mule'ing", gives you an unfair advantage over other players, and will not be tolerated. Every player shall send in orders for at most one faction. Sharing your password with another player so he can send in orders for your units is not allowed either, except if that player does not have a faction of his own.
:Once your faction has reached an age of at least 150 turns, it is allowed to start an additional faction.

;Taking over an existing faction.
:Taking over an existing faction is forbidden. If you quit the game you have to take care that your friends receive all your resources before your faction is deleted. Only in the case of vacations it is allowed to give your faction to another player, but you have to show this using the BANNER order.

;Exploiting bugs in the program.
:Knowledge of some bugs could give you a huge advantage if you use it. Bugs should be reported immediately. Using them to your advantage will get you banned from the game.

;Abusive social behavior
:Eressea started as a game among friends. For a long time, a paragraph like this was unnecessary. Eressea has grown, and while we still think of all the players as nice people, and many have become good friends, not all of them are. Be nice to each other. Even your worst enemy in the game is probably a great person.
