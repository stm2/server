As in every major persistent online world, the rules for playing Eressea are subject to change. We have continuously tried to improve the rules, balancing them for better playability, and adding new features to provide more depth and an even better gaming experience. There are no guarantees that the rules stay the way they are (though most do).

Eressea is a hobby. The core team of developers is spending many, many hours of unpaid time every week to keep it going. There have been times when we wanted to quit. Please remember that we're doing this as a free service.
