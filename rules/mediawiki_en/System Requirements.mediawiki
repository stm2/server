Eressea requires very little to play. Apart from an email account, the only thing you need is a computer and a text editor. This can be notepad for Windows, or even vi or emacs for Linux. You could even type the orders directly into your mail tool if you like. Make sure you use a plain text editor, not a word processor like Staroffice or Word; the game cannot read anything but plain text.

Most likely, though, you will want something more visual. There are some wonderful graphical clients available to play Eressea with, like Magellan or EMap, as well as secondary tools for statistics, order preprocessing or mapmaking. All of these can be found at [http://www.eressea.de/de/downloads.shtml http://www.eressea.de/de/downloads.shtml] and best of all, they are all free, written by players for players.
