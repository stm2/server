It is not possible to rerun a turn for an individual player. It's either all the players or none of them. Because of this, reruns are rarely ever done, and only if the bug affects a large number of players and is deemed threatening to their existence. Even then, it's still a decision that's made by the game masters alone, and is not guarenteed.

If you can't live with this, stop reading now.

There are several good reasons against reruns. Many players start with their orders as soon as they get the report. Announcing a rerun 24 hours later means they all have to start from scratch, destroying something on the order of 100 hours of work that's already been put into the next weeks turn. More importantly though, a rerun also means additional costs for the GM's, both time and money.

If your losses due to a confirmed bug are extremely severe, you can sometimes get silver or units as a replacement. Since this also amounts to extra work for the GM, there's no guarantee for this either.
