::''"Thus you know, manling, that your time has already expired before they come. The forces of the Draig gather themselves at the boundries of order. They will shatter you, as we have shattered your swords and spears. They will sweep you from the face of the earth like the evening wind blowing dust from the petals of a desert flower. The Draig are power, and power is the Draig... I see you doubt? You think you can conquer the Draig? Presumptuous manling, you will never restrain the Draig, because the length of one hundred lifetimes is nothing. You want to be be a servant of the Draig? Know then that the Draig need no servants, because the Draig were at the beginning, and they will be at the end."''
