<tt>ENTERTAIN  [amount]   <L></tt>

A unit with this order spends a turn entertaining the peasants. It can earn up to 20 pieces of silver per person and skill level in entertainment. The peasants spend five percent of their silver on entertainment. If there are more entertainers in the region than the peasants would pay, the silver is divided up among the entertaining units. You can specify a maximum amount of silver to be earned through entertainment.

Example: The peasants of a region own 1200 pieces of silver. Thus, the maximum amount of silver to be earned in this region is 1200 × 5% = 60.

Take two units: A with one person and an entertainment skill level of one, B with two persons and an entertainment skill level of two. A could earn 1 × 1 × 20 = 20 pieces of silver, B 2 × 2 × 20 = 80 pieces, i.e. a total of 100 pieces of silver.

Since the region will only yield 60 pieces of silver, they are split up at a ratio of about 20:80. Thus, A earns about 12 and B about 48 pieces of silver.

Units on board a ship in a [[GUARD|guarded region]] can neither [[WORK|work]] nor entertain.
