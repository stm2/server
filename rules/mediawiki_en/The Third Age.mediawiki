'''The third age''' (German: [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://wiki.eressea.de/de/Das_dritte_Zeitalter Das dritte Zeitalter]) is the title for a new game based on Eressea with some radically different rules. This page documents the preliminary rules for the game as agreed on and implemented by the design team. Changes may happen at any time (E3A is a play in the river :), we're still figuring things out. Live development updates can be found on [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://twitter.com/eresseadev http://twitter.com/eresseadev]

Players are asked to report any errors in the game to the game master, especially if they bring advantages. You may report errors at [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://bugs.eressea.de/ Mantis]. The bug report should contain your faction number and the number of a unit and/or affected regions. The given orders may also be helpful.

Registration was free and is curently no longer possible. The game has started on July, 1st 2009 with 452 players.

You may find announcements on changes here: [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://wiki.eressea.de/en/Announcements_%28E3%29 Announcements (E3)]

# Orders must be [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://wiki.eressea.de/w/en/index.php?title=Send_Orderss&action=edit&redlink=1 sent] to eressea-server@eressea.de with the subject line &quot;E3 ORDERS&quot; (for German orders: &quot;E3 Befehle&quot;).
# To reduce the amount of units required, there is no more perception or stealth, and likewise, no stealing.
# All money-making commands except for WORK (i.e. BUY/SELL/TAX/ENTERTAIN) have been removed.
# A faction can have a maximum of 200 units.
# The TEACH command has been removed.
# The SABOTAGE command has been removed.
# The SPY command has been removed.
# The DELIVER command has been removed. Use @GIVE to achieve the same result.
# The SIEGE command has been removed.
# The WORK command produces only enough money for the unit to survive (the upkeep).
# You can no longer give persons (units) to other factions.
# Silver can only be given to other factions at a 2 to 1 ratio (rounding down for each unit). For example &quot;<code>GIVE abc 2 silver</code>&quot; costs 2 silver, but only 1 silver arrives at unit <code>abc</code>, &quot;<code>GIVE abc 3 silver</code>&quot; costs 3 silver, but still only 1 silver arrives at unit <code>abc</code>. If two units each do GIVE def 1 silver to a foreign unit def, ''no'' silver arrives at this unit. You can give ''all other items'' to other factions normally.
# GIVE COMMAND still works as usual, but has been moved before &quot;LEAVE&quot; in the order of execution
# Hunger does not stop long orders.
# Faction stealth and demon's ability to hide their race have been disabled.
# Tactics costs 500 silver (instead of 200). The cost of learning magic does not change. (50+25*(1+level)*level).
# Guard keeps its current function, but taxation is no longer influenced by it. There are plans to modify the siege command to block region income. This is not implemented yet, however.
# Units in a lighthouse automatically see the maximum range, a skill is no longer necessary.
# Building owners have to issue a LEAVE order before being able to move.
# Natural armor is &quot;symmetrically half-additive&quot; to normal armor, i.e., half of the smaller value is added to the larger value.
# Allies without silver will be provided with silver by the region owner first, before other unit's reserves are touched.
# The order of execution of orders has been adapted slightly: [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://wiki.eressea.de/en/Table_of_orders#Order_of_Execution Table of orders#Order of Execution]
# A unit that flees from a combat is put at the last place in the ordering of units of the region (so it can't enter buildings before victorious units).

<span id="Alliances"></span>
== <span class="mw-headline"> Alliances </span> ==

# There is no HELP COMBAT option
# There is a new ALLIANCE command to form an alliance.
# Alliances are invisible for factions outside the alliance.
# You can only be in one alliance at a time.
# All members of an alliance have an automatic HELP COMBAT status towards each other.
# All groups of a faction have the same HELP COMBAT statuses.
# Each alliance has an admin, usually the person that created the alliance.
# ALLIANCE KICK &lt;faction-id&gt; removes a faction from the alliance (admin only)
# ALLIANCE LEAVE leaves the current alliance
# ALLIANCE COMMAND &lt;faction-id&gt; makes another faction the admin (admin only)
# ALLIANCE NEW creates a new alliance with you as the owner
# ALLIANCE INVITE &lt;faction-id&gt; invites another faction to your alliance for this turn (admin only)
# ALLIANCE JOIN &lt;alliance-id&gt; joins another alliance (if you got an invitation in the same turn)
# NAME ALLIANCE &quot;name of alliance&quot; gives the alliance a name
# Changing alliances will be possible within one turn.
# Members of your alliance are marked with 'o' in the NR (instead of '*', '+', and '-').

<span id="Races"></span>
== <span class="mw-headline"> Races </span> ==

See [http://web.archive.org/web/20110113091639/http://wiki.eressea.de/w/en/index.php?title=Races_in_the_Third_Age&action=edit&redlink=1 Races in the Third Age] for the philosophy behind the desing of races.

# Every faction has a main race that can be recruited for ca. $100/person ($60 for goblins), and a more expensive secondary race.
# Valid race combinations are (with secondary race): human(elf), halfling(dwarf), goblin(demon), orc(troll)
# Cats, insects and aquarians are not available as player races.
# To recruit the secondary race, specify the race, e.g. RECRUIT 10 TROLL. Units can not be mixed-race.
# The familiar races get shuffled around a bit.
# All races start with 20 hitpoints except for goblins who start with 16 and demons who start with 30.
# Orcs no longer start life with weapon skills.
# Hunger can no longer kill a fully rested unit.
# Hunger has negative consequences for learning.
# Hungry units do not regenerate hitpoints.

<span id="Racial_characteristics"></span>
== <span class="mw-headline"> Racial characteristics </span> ==

'''Goblins'''

# Obtain the recruitment bonus from Orcs (2 Goblins cost 1 peasant).
# Costs only 6 silver per week to maintain.
# Need only 0.6 &quot;seats&quot; in ships.
# Cannot use plate armor.
# Cannot use heavy melee weapons (see [[#Weapons_and_Armor|Weapons and Armor]]).
# Weigh only 6GE but can carry only 4.4 GE.
# Receive an attack bonus if they attack with three times as many people as their opponent.
# Unarmed goblins have a +2 bonus to their defense.
# Start with 16 hit points.
# Wounded Goblins regenerate 10% of their hit points per round.

# All skills with at least one skill point have a 25% chance of shifting. The skill can lose up to 3 skill levels of learning (40%), or rise up to 3 skill levels of learning (60%). No skill can ever fall below level 1 (before racial adjustments). This happens after long orders and movement.
# Demons do not suffer damage any more when they don't eat peasants. Instead, the skills shift happens with higher probability, and never rises.
# This increased skills shift also happens when starving because of lack of silver.
# Disguise as another race has been disabled.
# Recruited demons will not be deducted from peasants' pool. However, the normal recruitment limits still apply.
# When a demon unit gives away men (see the GIVE 0 order) these men are not added to the peasant population of the region but return to their home sphere instead.
# In combat, taking a hit from a demon causes panic in the victim. The victim receives a modifier of -1 to all combat skills for the rest of the combat.
# Start with 30 hit points (instead of 20).
# Peasants no longer flee from demons.

# Are the only player race that can build and use elven bows.
# Have only 3 mages like any other race.

# Costs of building and maintaining buildings are identical to E2.<br />

# <code>PAY NOT</code> postpones the payment of upkeep as well as the functioning of a building for one week. (@PAY NOT is of course valid as well). The second instance of paying upkeep for buildings in the order of execution has been removed. Therefore newly built buildings require no upkeep in the week they are first constructed. Buildings for which upkeep could not be paid in time simply do not function. However, buildings will not collapse for lack of payment anymore.
# Empty buildings and buildings whose maintenance cost haven't been paid do no longer risk demolition.
# Lighthouses do not need perception to function.<br />

# Harbours have only two functions left:
#* Ships bigger than boats can land in non-plains if there is a harbour.
#* A region with a harbour can be used as &quot;channel region&quot;, i.e., you can cast off in any direction (if you have HELP GUARD from the owner).
#* Harbours only work if they are complete. There can only be one working harbour per region.

<span id="Region_ownership"></span>
== <span class="mw-headline"> Region ownership </span> ==

# The faction with the biggest castle or watch (see below) in a region is the owner of that region.
# Regions are de facto guarded by the region owner, even without explicit GUARD order. Weapons are not needed for this.
# A new building, the watch, exists in thre sizes: 1-4: frame, 5-9: guard house, 10: guard tower. To build it, use MAKE WATCH (MACHE WACHE). Cost is 1 wood per size. The frame needs a masonry skill of 1, guard house and guard tower needs 2.
# The owner of a region gets 0,5%-5% of the region's silver in taxes every week, depending on the region's morale.
#* Example: Starting region with 50,000 silver, size 10 fortification (1%), morale 4 (2%) -&gt; min(1%, 2%) * 50000 silver = 500 silver income
# The tax money is given to the owner of the biggest castle.
# Taxation happens before the WORK order.
# Region ownership is recalculated after taxation.
# When region ownership changes, peasants are mourning in the following week. They work as little as possible (10 silver per peasant) and they don't pay taxes to the new owner.
# Silver distributed via HELP SILVER is taken from the region owner first. Only if he doesn't have silver left is it taken from other units.

# You will no longer get a skill bonus added to your damage.
# Halberds and claymores no longer give a bonus when used on horseback.
# Fighters with halberds or claymores cannot use a shield.
# Heroes have 3 attacks per turn, not 10.
# For every point in tactics that your army's commander is better than the enemy's, you get 10% (max. 100%) on your chance to deal a blow in the initial tactics round. So if you have 2 more point in tactics, then approx. 20% of your army will be able to attack during the initial round.
# Horses give ''no'' benefit in combat excpet 10% increase in the chance to flee (with T1 riding).

<ol>
<li>Peasants in every region have an initial morale of 2.</li>
<li>When a region loses its' owner, morale falls to 0. If the region owner faction changes by GIVE COMMAND, moral only drops by 2 points. Additionally, the peasants will declare the following turn a week of mourning, during which they will only do necessary work (earn 10 silver) and will not pay taxes to the new owner. This means that in case of a region given freely the new owner may receive taxes in the week of handover, and the morale of the peasants will be prefixed with &quot;mourning&quot;. In the ''next'' week the new owner does not receive any taxes.</li>
<li>For every few (less than 10 ''on average'') under the same ownership, a region's morale rises by 1 point up to a maximum of 10.</li>
<li>Regions owned by halflings have a higher effect on the peasants' morale.</li>
<li>A region's taxes are a percentage of the peasants' wealth equal to the region's morale (divided by 2) or the size of the biggest castle or watch, whichever is smaller.</li>
<li>Morale in the NR has the following meaning:
0 = rebellious
1 = mad?
2 = angry?
3 = uneasy?
4 = indifferent?
5 = relaxed
6 = content
7 = happy
8 = loyal
9 = devoted
10 = subservient</li>
<li>A new building, the market, replaces trade and herbalism.
<ol>
<li>With a market, factions can receive herbs and luxury goods produced in the region and its 6 adjacent regions.</li>
<li>Each region can only have one market per faction (further markets are ignored).</li>
<li>Markets need to have a size of 10, with each size-step costing 1 wood and 1 stone. You need masonry 3 to build a market.</li>
<li>Market upkeep is 200 silver/turn.</li>
<li>Except for upkeep on the market there is no cost to trade.</li>
<li>Markets only allow buying, not selling of goods.</li></ol>

<li>Herbs and Luxury items are used as spell ingredients.</li>
<li>Herbs do not rot.</li></ol>

# Ships have been completely redesigned.
# Ships that drift off do not take damage any more.
# Persons and freight are being handled separately.
# The value for maximum passengers is modified by the persons' weight. For example, a caravel can carry 150 humans, elves, dwarves, ... but 250 goblins (6 WU each) and only 75 trolls (20 WU each).
# The given freight capacity is only for items.
# Captains receive a +1 bonus to their ships' range for every 6 levels of sailing skill above the minimum captain skill (canoe with skill 7 = +1, 13 = +2, 19 = +3)
# Passengers of war ships get a defense bonus when they fight. This bonus only applies to battles on sea.
# Passengers of rowing ships get attack bonus and have a 20% change per point of difference of the skill of their own tactician to attack in the tactics round instead of the usual 10% (see the changed tactics rule). This bonus only applies to battles on sea.
# There are four classes of ships
## boats, which may only sail along coasts (with one exception).
## trade ships with much room for freight
## war ships for the heavily armored
## fast rowing ships for the lightly armored

*pers: the weight of the people (without gear) on the ship cannot exceed (pers*10)WU
''Fishing'': up to two people on any ship of the boat class do not need to pay for their upkeep if their turn ends on an ocean region.
''portable'': can leave in any direction, no matter which shore it has landed at.
''Boats'' can't go to the open see, but may go ashore everywhere.
''Trade ships'' are influenced less by storms (half chance).
''Rowing ships'' give their inmates double chance to attack during tactics round (ram and enter).
''protection from storms'' reduces the probability of drifting considerably
''strong protection from storms'' minimises the probability of drifting
