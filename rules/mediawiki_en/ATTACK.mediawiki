<tt>ATTACK unit-id <L*></tt>

This will cause the unit to attack the specified other unit. You must specify a separate ATTACK order for every unit you want to attack. A unit that has set its [[COMBAT|combat behaviour]] to FLEE or NOT cannot attack.

This order is only considered long if the battle takes more than one round. Otherwise, an additional long order can be executed.

The ATTACK order is a pseudo-long order. You can issue more than one ATTACK order, but an ATTACK order prevents the execution of other long orders if a battle actually takes place. Note, that for this purpose a unit is only participating in battle if on the average all persons of this unit have attacked or defended at least once during the battle. Thus, if one side defeats the other and not all persons of a unit attacked an enemy or defended against an enemy attack, the unit can execute another long order. This evaluation is done unit by unit. It is recommended to add another long order to be executed after very short battles. Do not count on its execution and do not include any results of these orders (silver, products, etc.) into your plans.
