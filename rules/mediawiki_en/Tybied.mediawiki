::''"Now, hmm, my young elf, you have recieved in the last half year one introduction of the practical magic. Fireballs, illusions, teleportation... and now, hmm, it is on me, to dispel your nonsense once again. Thankless, I say to you."''

::''"Let me explain to you, hmm, what magic is real. Surely someone told you the fact that it concerns the manipulation of energy, and, hmm, so the subject goes. It's all foolishness! You must learn, from examples you can comprehend, from those, hmm, you will learn magic exists. Its, hmm, internal structure, its sources, hmm, its strength. Only then, hmm, will it become all yours, such grandness as it is. Then you will know, manipulate it as one, its Threads and Patterns changed, hmm, and at your discretion reassembled. Which then, hmm, I must admit, in that, hmm, practice can be quite useful."''
