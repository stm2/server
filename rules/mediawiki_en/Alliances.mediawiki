Alliances are the basis of cooperation in the world of Eressea. If you are looking to trade, declare war, or make peace, alliances are the cornerstone of player interaction. All alliances are formed using the [[HELP]] order.

If you use the [[HELP]] order to support another faction, it is by no means required to act likewise. It is up to the other faction to decide on how to reciprocate the alliance. The wise usually put alliances to the test before relying upon them.

In addition, there are several different types of the [[HELP]] order. To ensure that [[HELP]] is not abused, it is possible to limit what kind of "assistance" your allies can give you. Examples of sabotage include: a unit that is supposed to travel extensively could be weighed down with a bunch of stones, or an opponent's elite units could be reduced to regular units by adding unskilled men into their ranks.
