In a small tavern in Eryn'yn'Falathvorn, Sud-Andune:

::''Niolamel regarded the singer in fascination. The young elf could feel, see the strength which proceeded from his formal voice. She briefly regarded the remaining listeners. At the table beside her, sat the burly mountain elf from Dunfanaghy-Massiv. What had caused the heavily armed and prepared elf to strike so far south as he had? Quite peacefully sat the elf, one who belonged to such a wild and barbarishly ill-reputed clan, where he listend to the to the voice of the singer.''

::''An old man continued to sit at a table, one human in the uniform tunic of the 13th Legion. He did not look attractive, age had left clear marks over him. His right arm was broken, an obvious war crime. His right face was half covered in a deep scar, the blow from a war axe, Niolamel assumed. He too seemed to be taken prisoner by the voice of the singer, and for one moment, it appeared to the elf, as if the scar on the face of the old man would fade, and new life would pulsate in his grey skin.''
