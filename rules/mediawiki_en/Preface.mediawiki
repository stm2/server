When we started Eressea back in 1996, we would never have guessed that it would grow as much as it did. As I write this in May 2001, Eressea has 1,500 players in Germany alone. These English rules mark the beginning of another era for Eressea. We will finally be able to give the game to a much bigger audience. And we think you will like it, too.

Eressea is a game that is played entirely through email. It is a turn based game, much like conventional strategy games, but with more complex rules, and more players at the same time. The world of Eressea is the same it was 5 years ago, although it has expanded over time to accomodate more and more players. It is filled with stories and legends of heroic battles, great deeds and empires long gone. In a way, it is very alive.

To play, you have to send at least one email a week to the game server, explaining what you want your units (the people you control) to do. In return, you will get a weekly report telling you what happened in the world, showing you newly explored areas, results of your orders and messages from other players. At the moment, this happens once a week on Sunday. Your orders must arrive before 9 am, and the report will usually get to you before the end of the day.
